      "## The importance of data preprocessing\n",
      "\n",
      "Data preprocessing (also called data wrangling, data munging, cleaning, scrubbing, etc) is the most important thing you will do with your data because it sets the stage for the analysis part of your data analysis workflow. The preprocessing you do largely depends on what kind of data you have, what sort of analysis you'll be doing with your data, and what you intend to do with the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preprocessing is also a process for getting to know your data, and can answer questions such as these (and more): \n",
      "\n",
      "- What kind of data are you working with? \n",
      "- Is it categorical, continuous, or a mix of both? \n",
      "- What's the distribution of features in your dataset? \n",
      "- What sort of wrangling do you have to do?\n",
      "- Do you have any missing data? \n",
      "- Do you need to remove missing data?\n",
      "- Do you need only a subset of your data?\n",
      "- Do you need more data?\n",
      "- Or less?\n",
      "\n",
      "The questions you'll have to answer are, again, dependent upon the data that you're working with, and preprocessing can be a way to figure that out.\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is Pandas?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pandas is by far my favorite preprocessing tool. It's a data wrangling/modeling/analysis tool that is similar to R and Excel; in fact, the DataFrame data structure in Pandas was named after the DataFrame in R. Pandas comes with several easy-to-use data structures, two of which (the Series and the DataFrame) I'll be covering here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll also be covering a bunch of different wrangling tools, as well as a couple of analysis tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why Pandas?\n",
      "\n",
      "So, why would you want to use Python, as opposed to tools like R and Excel? I like to use it because I like to keep everything in Python, from start to finish. It just makes it easier if I don't have to switch back and forth between other tools. Also, if I have to build in preprocessing as part of a production system, which I've had to do at my job, it makes sense to just do it in Python from the beginning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pandas is great for preprocessing, as we'll see, and it can be easily combined with other modules from the scientific Python stack.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pandas data structures\n",
      "\n",
      "Pandas has several different data structures, but we're going to talk about the Series and the DataFrame.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Series\n",
      "\n",
      "The Series is a one-dimensional array that can hold a variety of data types, including a mix of those types. The row labels in a Series are collectively called the index. You can create a Series in a few different ways. Here's how you'd create a Series from a list."
